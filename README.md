#Fighting Kitten

Welcome to the Fighting Kitten project, and thanks for reading ^^. Please visit the <a href="http://fightingkitten.webcindario.com/" target="_blank">Official Website</a>.

I'm a very much bored girl that loves to code. I decided to start this project with these main purposes:

1. To prove myself.

2. To learn by doing.

3. To have fun.

<strong>Presentation</strong>

Fighting Kitten is meant to become a simple video game about... well, about a kitten that fights against enemies. That kitten is in fact representing me, and enemies will represent the challenges I had to overcome during my life.

<a href="http://fightingkitten.webcindario.com/wp-content/uploads/first_approach.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a>'s a first approach of how the main char should look like. It's a pig-tailed girl that wears a cat pajama. Due to my artistic ineptitude, art contributions are very welcome ^^'.

Well, at least, that's the goal. But, in a more sentimental way, this game is my playground. This is the sandbox where I try all those cool features that I luckily discover and are liable to be implemented. I will not rush and I will not serve any concrete objective, it's all about learning.

<strong>Tech</strong>

I will use Java with <a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/index.html" target="_blank">LibGDX</a> library for the development, as it is a really fast and comfortable library once you've learned the basics.

I will share my code on <a href="https://github.com/mericp/FightingKitten.git" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and I will post here an explanation of the problems I faced, the decisions I made, and the feelings I had. This way, you can track my progress through this feat. Comments and constructive criticism are welcomed!

Enjoy!
